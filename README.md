# torch_data_tutorial

Go to [Colab_test] link and run code cells in sequence. I am still building the tutorial in [Colab] link now, but you should be able to run everything smoothly in [Colab_test]. On the colab website, you can simply click on Runtime tab and choose to Run all. <br/><br/>
Let me know if you have any questions running code cells in [Colab_test]. <br/><br/>
